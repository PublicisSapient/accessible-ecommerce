**Welcome to Publicis.Sapient Toronto’s accessible e-commerce demo store** – the first of its kind in the world. We designed and developed it as a teaching and learning tool for our internal teams as well as for everyone, and we are excited to have our initial launch on Global Accessibility Awareness Day, 2018. 

Our initial launch consists of a clickable wireframe of the Product Listing Page. We will continue building on this in subsequent releases until we have a complete e-commerce on Global Accessibility Awareness Day in 2019. We will also be adding documentation related to the thinking and the code behind each accessible component as we go. One of our final steps will be to work with our creative team to apply an eye-catching yet contrast-friendly design skin to the storefront.

## What our demo is, and what it is not
* **It is fully keyboard navigable and screenreader-friendly** in it's current state. Navigate with your tab key to discover hidden wayfinding cues, and note how we tried to provide screenreader users with the appropriate amount of context and information as they navigated through the site.
* **It is not fully designed.** Think of it as a clickable wireframe right now. We are working out all of the interactions first, then applying an eye-catching design later.
* **It is not fully functional** at the moment. For example, right now you can't add an item to your cart. We plan to make that work shortly. This is as far as we got for Global Accessibility Awareness Day.
* **It is not representative of today's best coding standards -- yet.** This code came out of multiple hackathon sessions. The point of the demo today is to showcase how an accessible e-commerce website should feel and behave. We will clean up the code later.
* **It is not perfect.** We didn't want to waste time trying to make it perfect before getting it out there. The danger would be that it would never be perfect enough. Edward de Bono said it best:
> An idea that is developed and put into action is more important than an idea that exists only as an idea.

## 3 reasons to build an accessible e-commerce demo store:
1. **To teach our internal teams how to navigate the web with their keyboards alone, and with assistive devices like screen readers.** Would you ask someone who had only ever driven a car to design the perfect bike? Probably not. But that is essentially what we are asking designers and developers to do when we ask people who have always navigated with a mouse pointing device to design and build something that works for a keyboard user.
2.	**To give our creative and development teams the time and space to research and document the accessibility considerations of common e-commerce storefront components.** Accessibility compliance is a team effort, and requires collaboration from every discipline, including user experience designers, visual designers, developers, product owners, etc. 
3.	**To create a live example of an accessible e-commerce storefront that we can show to our clients and to the world at large,** both to showcase our expertise and to share the knowledge with everyone. Our main goal is to accelerate the adoption of accessible design and development practices to make content more accessible to everyone, sooner.

## Accessible Product Listing Page Components
Every component of our Product Listing Page was thoroughly researched from accessibility and usability lenses. The accessibility considerations, applied to individual components, were taught and discussed over the course of multiple accessibility “deep dive” sessions. Subsequently, these components were then designed and developed by teams of user experience designers and front-end developers during a 3-hour hackathon. Finally, visual designers worked with developers to standardize the look and feel of the page.

In the coming weeks, we will post the learnings from our deep dive sessions as a series of blog posts for each component. Our Product Listing Page component list includes: 
* the global navigation menu 
* the footer 
* the mini-cart  
* the product filter and sorting mechanisms 
* the product tile 

Navigate to our [Product Listing Page](https://publicissapient.github.io/accessible-ecommerce-demo/pages/plp/plp.html) and experience how it feels to use it with your keyboard alone, with a screen reader, or with any other assistive device. If you experience any issues, please let us know [how?] so we can address them.

## The unfulfilled promise of the internet
From the late 1990s onward, the internet gradually became part of our lives. In 2016, it was estimated that 3.4 billion people regularly used “the Web”. With more and more people using the internet, physical modes of content were steadily replaced by electronic modes of content. A big part of the shift was that commerce at physical locations was replaced or augmented by e-commerce storefronts. 

This shift from physical to electronic modes of content had the potential to remove many of the barriers to communication that existed for people with disabilities in the physical world. *This was one of the most exciting promises of the internet.*

A recent accessibility audit by Publicis.Sapient found that 6 out of 10 of the world’s top ecommerce sites are inaccessible to people with disabilities, and the remaining 4 score low grades (C or D) for usability.  This is a strong indication that this promise of the internet has not been fulfilled. 

About 35 million people in the US have disabilities that impact their ability to use the web – vision loss, hearing loss, or cognitive disabilities. This number is approaching the population of Canada! The number of Canadians with web-impacting disabilities numbers around 750,000. This is a significant population.

Most people today can hardly conceive of life without the Internet, or without e-commerce. But these online retail stores are effectively CLOSED for this population. 35 million people in the US is a huge market that businesses should want to tap into, and it’s the right thing to do. We have the tools, and the knowledge is out there. Creating accessible websites isn’t happening because designers and developers are not familiar with the ways that people who need accessible experiences navigate online, and they are thus unable to devise accessible interactive paradigms.

## Our Goal at Publicis.Sapient Toronto
At Publicis.Sapient Toronto we are aiming to change that through our investment in the time it takes to create a fully accessible e-commerce storefront to share with the world, including the ongoing in-house screen reader and keyboard navigation training sessions and the accessibility deep dive sessions per component. We look forward to your feedback and collaboration.
